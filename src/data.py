Raef Bassily
About me
I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and a core faculty member at the Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI) at The Ohio State University.   I am also a part-time visiting scientist at Google. My research interests span several areas such as privacy-preserving data analysis, machine learning, optimization, and information theory. I am broadly interested in studying the tension/harmony between data analysis and machine learning on one hand and other notions of central importance to people and society such as privacy and security. In my work, I enjoy applying various tools from several areas such as learning theory, optimization, statistics, and information theory. 

My research focuses on tackling current challenges in data analysis and machine learning  especially those of direct impact on society. My recent research effort has been devoted to developing practical algorithms with rigorous guarantees for privacy-preserving data analysis and machine learning. The goal of this area of research is to design highly accurate machine learning and data analysis algorithms that use private, personal data while providing rigorous guarantees of privacy for individuals whose data are collected; that is, to achieve the seemingly paradoxical goal of learning from private data without learning private data! A major part of my research focuses on addressing fundamental questions in machine learning and differential privacy. 

Before joining OSU, I was a data-science postdoctoral fellow at University of California, San Diego. Prior to this, I was a postdoc in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University. I completed my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Maryland, College Park. 

I am supported by multiple NSF grants, including the NSF CAREER Award, and a  Google Faculty Research Award. I am also a recipient of OSU's 2022 Lumely Faculty Research Award.

Introduction
This page gives an overview of and links to recent research papers that describe some of the research of my lab. The commentary for some papers gives links to follow-on work so that the reader can see the trajectories of the different research lines.

My group's current research covers a number of topics in speech and natural language processing. The overall goal of my lab's research is to find meaningful ways to integrate acoustic, phonetic, lexical, and other linguistic insights into the speech recognition process through a combination of statistical modeling and data/error analysis. My goal is to train students to be flexible, independent thinkers who can apply statistical techniques to a range of language-related problems.

Joining the lab
The Speech and Language Technologies Laboratory is a group of dynamic researchers who are interested in mixing aspects of machine learning with speech and language processing.

Selected papers (with commentary)
D. Bagchi, P. Plantinga, A. Stiff, and E. Fosler-Lussier, "Spectral feature mapping with mimic loss for robust speech recognition,", ICASSP 2018.
For the task of speech enhancement, local learning objectives are agnostic to phonetic structures helpful for speech recognition. We propose to add a global criterion to ensure de-noised speech is useful for downstream tasks like ASR. We first train a spectral classifier on clean speech to predict senone labels. Then, the spectral classifier is joined with our speech enhancer as a noisy speech recognizer. This model is taught to imitate the output of the spectral classifier alone on clean speech. This mimic loss is combined with the traditional local criterion to train the speech enhancer to produce de-noised speech. Feeding the de-noised speech to an off-the-shelf Kaldi training recipe for the CHiME-2 corpus shows significant improvements in WER.

D. Newman-Griffis, A. Lai, and E. Fosler-Lussier, "Jointly embedding entities and text with distant supervision," Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, 2018.
Learning representations for knowledge base entities and concepts is becoming increasingly important for NLP applications. However, recent entity embedding methods have relied on structured resources that are expensive to create for new domains and corpora. We present a distantly-supervised method for jointly learning embeddings of entities and text from an unnanotated corpus, using only a list of mappings between entities and surface forms. We learn embeddings from open-domain and biomedical corpora, and compare against prior methods that rely on human-annotated text or large knowledge graph structure. Our embeddings capture entity similarity and relatedness better than prior work, both in existing biomedical datasets and a new Wikipedia-based dataset that we release to the community. Results on analogy completion and entity sense disambiguation indicate that entities and words capture complementary information that can be effectively combined for downstream use.

J.K. Kim, Y.B. Kim, R. Sarikaya, and E. Fosler-Lussier "Cross-lingual transfer learning for POS tagging without cross-lingual resources," EMNLP 2017.
Training a POS tagging model with crosslingual transfer learning usually requires linguistic knowledge and resources about the relation between the source language and the target language. In this paper, we introduce a cross-lingual transfer learning model for POS tagging without ancillary resources such as parallel corpora. The proposed cross-lingual model utilizes a common BLSTM that enables knowledge transfer from other languages, and private BLSTMs for language-specific representations. The cross-lingual model is trained with language-adversarial training and bidirectional language modeling as auxiliary objectives to better represent language-general information while not losing the information about a specific target language. Evaluating on POS datasets from 14 languages in the Universal Dependencies corpus, we show that the proposed transfer learning model improves the POS tagging performance of the target languages without exploiting any linguistic knowledge between the source language and the target language.

Y. He and E. Fosler-Lussier. "Segmental Conditional Random Fields with Deep Neural Networks as Acoustic Models for First-Pass Word Recognition," Interspeech 2015, Dresden, Germany, 2015.
In this line of research, my lab engaged in a series of studies to build automatic speech recognition systems using direct discriminative models that can combine correlated evidence of linguistic events. This work is the lastest step in this line of research: it provides a discriminative framework for modeling longer trajectories in speech through segmental models. The innovation in this particular paper is the first one-pass discriminative segmental model for word recognition (building on our previous work in phone recognition). We show that the monophone-based model improves recognition over discriminatively trained monophone-based HMM and Frame-based CRF models for the Wall Street Journal read-speech task, and starts to approach triphone-based performance. Thus, this serves as a good intermediate point in building systems that can start to compete with state-of-the-art systems.

Recognized as a Spotlight Poster at ASRU 2011 (voted as a top 3 poster in its session by the attendees).

Segmental modeling can be thought of as a type of linguistic structural modeling (integrating linguistic structure over time). Another linguistic-inspired modeling approach that we have experimented with, in conjunction with partners at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, explicitly models articulator trajectories over time through a factored model -- unlike phone-based systems, this paradigm allows models of asynchrony which can account for different types of pronunciation variation commonly seen in continuous speech. In this paper, we use factorized Conditional Random Fields in order to learn patterns of asynchrony that can be utilized in providing articulatory feature transcriptions that can be expensive to obtain manually. Our experiments show that the transcriptions can better account for pronunciation variations observed by linguists in the Switchboard corpus. In subsequent papers, we were able to utilize this framework for acoustic-based keyword spotting, showing improvement over a HMM-based baseline.

Best Student Paper Award, Interspeech 2012

This paper takes a slightly different approach to articulatory modeling than the Prabhavalkar work described above, starting from a previous Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) approach and efficiently derives, as well as discriminatively trains, a weighted finite state transducer (WFST) representation for the articulatory feature-based model of pronunciation. We use the conditional independence assumptions imposed by the DBN to efficiently convert it into a sequence of WFSTs (factor FSTs) which, when composed, yield the same model as the DBN. We then introduce a linear model of the arc weights of the factor FSTs and discriminatively learn its weights using the averaged perceptron algorithm. We demonstrate the approach using a lexical access task in which we recognize a word given its surface realization. This work subsequently led to discriminative training approaches for factorized WFSTs that can be used even in standard WFST-based ASR systems.

One line of research that we have followed is to use some of the discriminative techniques that we have developed in speech recognition in concert with speech separation techniques inspired by (and often in collaboration with) my colleague DeLiang Wang. The paper highlighted here was an outgrowth of this work, in which my student Billy Hartmann and I asked whether it was possible to use speech separation directly on noisy speech data to mask out noise without any reconstruction of the masked componenets in ASR. Previously it was assumed that zero-energy "holes" would cause problems in spectrally-masked speech that was not reconstructed or where the missing components were not marginalized in the probability estimation. The baseline for these latter techniques was usually just the recognition on the non-modified (noisy) speech. In this paper we show that one can use masked speech data directly in recognition, and argue that this should be the "simple" baseline from which other techniques are based.

Awarded IEEE Signal Processing Society Best Paper Award in 2010.
This paper details a model which can selectively pay attention to some phonological information and ignore other information using a discriminative model known as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). While CRFs had been used in a few studies prior to this work, the contribution of this paper was to examine their utility as feature combiners, combining posterior estimates of phone classes and phonological feature classes to improve TIMIT phone recognition. We have continued this line of research since this paper, moving towards the first CRF-based word recognition experiments ever done.

Much of the work above is devoted to methods of modeling the acoustic-phonetic variation inherent in speech, in order to build better speech recognition models. However, a slightly different way of thinking about variation is to consider the variation in patterns of errors made by a speech recognizer due to many factors (for example, errors due to inherent speech variation, errors caused by poor acoustic/lexical models, or search errors). This paper focuses on methods to predict errors made by speech recognition systems, even when we only have a text transcript (i.e., no audio); the proposed framework is flexible enough to allow for different prediction models to characterize system performance. The impact of this technology has allowed us and others to train discriminative language models that directly optimize system error rate (rather than data likelihood) using a large amount of textual data.

Biography
My research focuses on multi-agent interactions that arise in combating societal challenges, especially in the areas of conservation and public health. These interactions often involve challenges of uncertainty in the environment and the utility functions of the agents, necessitating approaches that handle scarce data. To achieve this end, I combine methodologies from game theory and multi-agent systems with machine learning, robust planning and optimization techniques.

Before joining OSU, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Milind Tambe at Teamcore at the Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard. I completed my PhD in September 2018 under the supervision of Craig Boutilier at the University of Toronto.

To achieve this end, I combine methodologies from game theory and multi-agent systems with machine learning, robust planning and optimization techniques.

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. This semester, I’m leading a seminar on reinforcement learning for optimization.

Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Milind Tambe at Teamcore at the Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard. I completed my PhD in September 2018 under the supervision of Craig Boutilier at University of Toronto.

Research interests: decision-making in uncertain multi-agent systems with social good applications (game theory, sequential decision-making, machine learning, optimization, agent-based modeling)

I'm a Distinguished Assistant Professor of Engineering Inclusive Excellence at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, where I co-direct the OSU NLP group, co-lead the Foundational AI team in the ICICLE AI Institute and lead the Machine Learning Foundations team in the Imageomics Institute. I also spend some fun time at Microsoft Semantic Machines. I got my PhD from University of California, Santa Barbara and my bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University, both in Computer Science.

I have broad interests in developing artificial intelligence, with a primary interest in the role of language, as a vehicle of thought and communication, in both artificial and human intelligence. These days, I'm particularly fond of foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal ones, and I believe they are an important step towards more general AI and should be studied thoroughly. I enjoy developing language agents that, in a robust and trustworthy way, automate a lot of our tedious tasks and make the computing world more accessible to all. I like to make things that work, which often means operating at scale and in real-world settings. For that I also deeply care about generalizability, interpretability, efficiency, and robustness. Finally, I believe in translational research and seek to leverage AI capabilities to empower a variety of domains such as biology and biomedicine, and meanwhile seek inspirations from these disciplines to develop better AI.

I'm always looking for highly motivated students. Drop me an email with CV and transcripts if you are interested in natural language processing, machine learning, or AI in general (unfortunately due to the high volumn I may not be able to reply to every email)

RESEARCH AND TEACHING INTERESTS
My research broadly addresses ways that enable computers to process, understand, and respond to
sound information. I have specific interests in the areas of speech separation, speech assessment,
and audio privacy, to name a few, where I am interested in using these methods in real-world devices,
such as cell phones, hearing aids, and robots. The algorithms that I develop are based on
machine learning, signal processing, and statistics. I have developed and taught graduate-level courses
on deep learning, machine perception and speech processing. I’ve also taught graduate and
undergraduate courses on machine learning and programming.

Biography
Aylin Yener holds the Roy and Lois Chope Chair in Engineering at The Ohio State University since January 2020, and is Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and Professor of Integrated Systems Engineering.  Until December 2019, she was a Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering and a Dean’s Fellow at Penn State, where she joined in 2002 as an assistant professor. In 2008-2009, she was a visiting associate professor in the Electrical Engineering Department at Stanford University, and in 2016-2017 she was a visiting professor in the same department. She also held a visiting position in Telecom Paris Tech in the summer of 2016.

Yener’s research studies networked entities. Her current focus areas relate to various pillars of next generation connectivity of computing, communicating and sensing entities (known as 6G) including smart environments, artificial intelligence and security/privacy. Yener is known for introducing several "first papers" in communications and information theory that led to research areas including physical layer security (2005 thanks to NSF), energy harvesting wireless communication networks (2009 thanks to NSF) (co-inventor), and semantic communications (2012 thanks to ARL). She is an unusual theorist who gets inspired by futuristic applications and seeks to make real life impact by foundational thinking. Her research has been supported by NSF, DARPA, NSA, ARL/ARO, DoT, and various industry and state entities.

Yener is a fellow of the American Association for Advancement Science (AAAS). She is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE).  She is an elected member of The Science Academy, Turkey.

Yener received the IEEE Communication Society Communication Theory Technical Achievement Award in 2020, the IEEE Communications Society Best Tutorial Paper Award in 2019, the IEEE Women in Communications Outstanding Achievement Award in 2018, the IEEE Marconi Prize Paper Award in 2014, and the IEEE ICC best paper award in 2010. In 2017, she was a Clariviate Analytics highly cited researcher. She has been a Distinguished Lecturer for three professional societies: IEEE Communication Society (2018-2019), IEEE Information Theory Society (2019-2021) and IEEE Vehicular Technology Society (2017-2021). She has delivered over 70 technical keynotes and invited lectures.

An active volunteer for IEEE, Yener was the president of the IEEE Information Theory Society in 2020.  She also served on the adcom for the IEEE Systems Council and as an elected member (among former society presidents) of the nominations and appointments committee of the Technical Activities Board of the IEEE. She served as the Treasurer, Board of Governors member,  Vice President and Past President of the IEEE Information Theory Society.  Simultaneously, she has held numerous volunteer roles (such as conference chair/organizer, editor) for the IEEE Communications, Information Theory, Signal Processing and Vehicular Technology Societies over the past two decades. Yener is the current Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transactions on Green Communication and Networking (2022-2026), a journal dedicated to energy sustainability of next generation networked systems, jointly sponsored by IEEE Communications Society, IEEE Signal Processing Society and IEEE Vehicular Technology Society.  

In 2022, Yener has been elected in the IEEE general elections as Division IX Director Elect which is a three year leadership position, with 2023 Director Elect, followed by 2024-2025 Director for Division IX. In this capacity, in addition to being Division IX director that places her as a voting member of the Technical Activities Board of the IEEE, she serves on the Board of Directors for IEEE.

Yener has mentored and trained 16 PhD students and 5 postdocs to date, who have gone on to professorships (with early career awards), and various top industries. She is committed to educational broader impact and is the co-founder of the IEEE North American School of Information Theory which runs annually since 2008. 

Fun fact: she had no idea buckeye was a type of nut prior to joining Ohio State.

Research Focus
My research area is in Networked Systems broadly defined. The focus is on system level design insights drawn from characterization of fundamental performance limits of such systems. We are generally
interested in systems consisting of multiple entities that communicate, network, sense, learn and compute. These can be large systems consisting of entities with heterogeneous capabilities and resources,
and represent the vision of the connected world, expected from 6G (and beyond). We seek for designs
that ensure secure, reliable and sustainable operations. Core research disciplines and tools that we engage
include information theory, optimization, communication theory and signal processing. We are interested
