      "I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and a core faculty member at the Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI) at The Ohio State University.   I am also a part-time visiting scientist at Google. My research interests span several areas such as privacy-preserving data analysis, machine learning, optimization, and information theory. I am broadly interested in studying the tension/harmony between data analysis and machine learning on one hand and other notions of central importance to people and society such as privacy and security. In my work, I enjoy applying various tools from several areas such as learning theory, optimization, statistics, and information theory. \n",
      "\n",
      "My research focuses on tackling current challenges in data analysis and machine learning  especially those of direct impact on society. My recent research effort has been devoted to developing practical algorithms with rigorous guarantees for privacy-preserving data analysis and machine learning. The goal of this area of research is to design highly accurate machine learning and data analysis algorithms that use private, personal data while providing rigorous guarantees of privacy for individuals whose data are collected; that is, to achieve the seemingly paradoxical goal of learning from private data without learning private data! A major part of my research focuses on addressing fundamental questions in machine learning and differential privacy. \n",

      "Before joining OSU, I was a data-science postdoctoral fellow at University of California, San Diego.

My research focuses on the societal aspects of machine learning and algorithmic decision-making. I aim to understand the societal implications of machine learning and develop learning systems that are aligned with social norms and reliable in dynamic environments. The research topics of my recent works are (1) Trustworthy machine learning (e.g., fairness, privacy, security, robustness, interpretability); (2) Learning in uncertain and dynamic environments (e.g., strategic classification, out-of-distribution generalization); (3) Learning from distributed agents (e.g., federated learning); (4) AI for sciences (e.g., healthcare, earth sciences).\n",

      "I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. I am also affiliated with the Translational Data Analytics Institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "My research focuses on the societal aspects of machine learning and algorithmic decision-making. I aim to understand the societal implications of machine learning and develop learning systems that are aligned with social norms and reliable in dynamic environments. The research topics of my recent works are: (1) Trustworthy machine learning (e.g., fairness, privacy, security, robustness, interpretability); (2) Learning in uncertain and dynamic environment (e.g., strategic classification, out-of-distribution generalization); (3) Learning from distributed agents (e.g., federated learning); (4) AI for Science (e.g., healthcare, earth sciences). For more details, please see my publications. Our research is generously supported by the National Science Foundation, Cisco, Center for Clinical and Translational Science, and Nationwide Children's Hospital, and OSU Translational Data Analytics Institute.\n",
